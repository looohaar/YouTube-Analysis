# YouTube Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview

This project involves extracting, transforming, and analyzing YouTube data. The data was extracted using the YouTube Data API v3 with a Python script, transformed and cleaned using Pandas, stored in MS SQL Server, and visualized using Power BI.

## Project Steps
1. Data Extraction:

* Used YouTube Data API v3 to extract data.
* Wrote a Python script to handle the data extraction process.

2. Data Transformation and Cleaning:

* Employed Pandas in Python to transform and clean the extracted data.
* Exported the cleaned data to a CSV file.

3. Data Loading:

* Loaded the CSV file into MS SQL Server.
* Performed additional data cleaning and transformations using SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Conducted EDA using SQL Server Management Studio to understand the data and extract insights.

5. Data Visualization:

* Connected the MS SQL Server database to Power BI Desktop.
* Created a dashboard and visualizations in Power BI to present the analysis results.

## Tools and Technologies
1. YouTube Data API v3: For data extraction.
2. Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
3. Pandas: For data transformation and cleaning.
4. MS SQL Server: For data storage and additional transformation.
